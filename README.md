UV-Luminosity Attenuations done in Galacticus. They will be included as a module that not only compute Luminosity Functions, but also attenuations both by molecular clouds and diffuse dust.
Hopefully this can be included as an easy post-processing task for those aiming to work on attenuating galaxies. Thank you a lot to A. Robertson for contributing a great part of this work!
